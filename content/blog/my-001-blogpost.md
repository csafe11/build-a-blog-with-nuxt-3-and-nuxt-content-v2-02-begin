# Easy Money with HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Stupid easy

Intro

what up today we're gonna go over my process

of how i'm making money as a freelance web

developer while i'm job hunting so for me i

have a family to take care of while i'm in

the process of hunting for a job so i had

to find ways to make money one way that i

started making money is freelance web

development and today i'm gonna show you my

process of generating leads who my target

consumer is and how do i create these

websites for people in order to supplement

my income i don't know if this is gonna be

sustainable or scalable in the future to be

something bigger but at the very least this

is generating some income during my job

search and it is been very helpful so i

figured i would share with you guys what i

do so first you got to come up with who is
Who is your target?

your target client and for me i was

thinking of the average man that has a

small business and maybe it's just him it's

somebody cutting grass doing plumbing doing

electric but they are their own business

and these people don't necessarily need lot

of features on a website but they do need a

website because in this day and age the

first thing people do when you have a

business is

look for a website they google you now i've

gotten a lot of crap for this because i'm i

i could make more money if i target bigger

clients but that's not my purpose here my

purpose is to gain more experience and to

help other people that aren't necessarily

tech savvy doesn't necessarily need to pay

a subscription for like wix or wordpress or

something like that they just need

something simple they need some html css

and maybe a little bit of javascript and

they don't have to worry about it again for

another year or two and that's where i come

in that is my target audience that is my

target clientele so what i do is the way
st way to get leads

that i generate leads is that i'm on the

next door app and there seems to be low

competition in my area through there and i

just make regular posts i just post like i

would anywhere else but i throw in web

services nextdoor app is full of people

asking for people to do yard work

electrical plumbing roofing

all these different things and when i see

those posts and i see someone on there i'll

find the person that posted like hey i do

this service and then i shoot them a

message when i shoot them the message or

just tell them who i am i tell them i'm

local and what i do and then i'm trying to

save you money that is one way that i

generate leads the second way that i

generate leads is i go on google maps and i
Thank you

literally i just want to say thank you guys

for watching my videos the channel's

growing fast please hit like and subscribe

and if you get any job leads let me know my

emails on my channel thank you

back to the video just start looking
nd way to get leads

through the map for people that have small

businesses and then i look and see if they

have a website attached to their google

business page if they do not i call the

number or i shoot them an email and i ask

them hey do you need a website i can help
Pitch and price

you save money i'm willing to do it for

cheap my starting package is at  dollars

and that is for the most basic of basic web

pages number about me a few little things

like that i do offer more services going up

and to be a lot more but my target is to be

like i just want to save people money and

put a website up for you that is very

simple and shows people what you do and how
My X factor

to get a hold of you my X factor is

is that i will take the time to show each

individual person how to host their own

website on netfly so i will show them how

to manually deploy the zip file that i send

to them so that they can host it themselves

and it helps them save money and that is i

think what helps me stand out a little bit

because i'm not super greedy and i really

genuinely want to help the other people

that don't need a whole lot but i also need

to make a little bit of money in my pocket

so that is my go to that's my x factor

right so i market on nextdoor app i cold

call people on google maps and then i put
Tracking

it in a google sheet and i keep track of

who i called if they answered if they

didn't if they said yes if they said no if

they said call them back and i put it on my

google sheet i'm still in the early process

of this this still has a lot more to be

done in growth and i could definitely

streamline some processes but this has been

very valuable for me for now because i'm

getting the experience i'm doing bb sales

i'm putting a little bit of money in my

pocket i'm helping people i'm building

connections in other industries so yeah
Outro

that's my process of how i'm making money

during my job hunt i hope this was helpful
