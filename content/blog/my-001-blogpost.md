# Easy Money with HTML, CSS, Javascript

## I had to find ways to make money one way that i started making money is freelance web development

What’s up? Today we're going to go over my process of making money as a freelance web developer while I'm job hunting. I have a family to take care of, so I had to find ways to make money. One way I started making money is through freelance web development. Today, I'm going to show you my process of generating leads, identifying my target consumer, and creating websites to supplement my income. I don’t know if this will be sustainable or scalable in the future, but for now, it’s generating some income during my job search and has been very helpful. I figured I would share with you what I do.

First, you need to determine your target client. For me, I focused on the average small business owner—someone who might be cutting grass, doing plumbing, or working as an electrician. These individuals don’t need a lot of features on their websites, but they do need a basic online presence. Nowadays, when someone has a business, people Google them, so having a website is essential.

I've received some criticism for this approach, as I could make more money targeting larger clients. However, my purpose is to gain experience and help people who aren’t tech-savvy and don’t need to pay for subscriptions to platforms like Wix or WordPress. They just need something simple with HTML, CSS, and maybe a little JavaScript, and then they don't have to worry about it for another year or two. That’s where I come in; that is my target audience and clientele.

One way I generate leads is through the Nextdoor app, where there seems to be low competition in my area. I make regular posts offering web services. The app is full of people looking for yard work, electrical, plumbing, roofing, and other services. When I see those posts, I find the person offering the service and shoot them a message, introducing myself and explaining what I do. I tell them I’m local and aim to save them money.

The second way I generate leads is by using Google Maps. I look for small businesses and see if they have a website attached to their Google business page. If they don’t, I call them or send an email, asking if they need a website. I explain that I can help them save money and offer to do it for cheap. My starting package is basic, including an "about me" section and a few other elements, but I offer more comprehensive services as well.

My X factor is that I take the time to show each client how to host their own website on Netlify. I teach them how to manually deploy the zip file I send them so they can host it themselves, saving them money. This approach helps me stand out because I'm not overly focused on profit; I genuinely want to help people who don’t need much but still need a website.

I market on the Nextdoor app, cold call businesses from Google Maps, and keep track of my contacts in a Google Sheet. I note who I called, whether they answered, and if they asked me to call back. This process is still in its early stages and has room for improvement, but it has been valuable. I’m gaining experience, making some money, helping people, and building connections in various industries.

That's my process for making money during my job hunt. I hope this was helpful. Later!
