# Do you wanna rank number one on Google?

## Well I hate to say it, it's actually really hard.

Do you wanna rank number one on Google? It’s actually really hard. Years ago, it used to be easy, but now it's challenging. Today, I'm gonna share three ways you can rank number one on Google.

I got started in SEO when I was a kid with a website called Advice Monkey. It was a failed replication of Monster.com. I realized I needed SEO to get traffic, but after paying marketing firms with no results, I learned SEO myself.

1. Focus on Content
Google's Hummingbird update favors niche-focused, thorough content. For example, if you have a dating site, a basic article won’t cut it. Instead, write in-depth guides on creating profiles, engaging with matches, and planning dates. Be super thorough so readers find no gaps and all their questions answered.

2. Optimize Title Tag and Description
Always include your keyword in the title and meta description. They need to be appealing and flow naturally. Keywords in these areas increase click-through rates since people are more likely to click on results that seem relevant.

3. Use Google Search Console
Google Search Console is a free tool that shows which pages get traffic and which keywords get impressions and clicks. Use this data to refine your content by adding keywords naturally and making it more thorough. This can significantly boost your traffic.

 - To recap:

    1. Make your content thorough.
    2. Optimize your title tag and meta description.
    3. Use Google Search Console to enhance your content.
